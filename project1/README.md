# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a very basic book searching website that I built as my very first web development project. Everything is done from scratch using Flask and SQLAlchemy. All the book details were downloaded from goodreads.com as a notepad file and inserted into the database.

An user can log on and off from the website. Website lets users search for books and check their details. The book detail includes title of the book, author, release-date and ISBN number. I am hoping to expand the project so that an user can actually read the book online and buy them if he wants instead of just being able to check the detail of the book.
